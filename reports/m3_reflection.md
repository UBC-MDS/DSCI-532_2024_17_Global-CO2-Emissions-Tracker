## Milestone 3: Reflection

### Dashboard implementation and modification
We have kept all the features specified in our initial proposal and Milestone 1, while further enhancing the style and layout of our dashboard.

**Global Emissions Overview**: We introduced a "Show all countries" checkbox to control the map display, allowing users to view total CO2 emissions globally. This feature is designed to stimulate interest in specific regions or countries, encouraging further exploration through the country dropdown menu for detailed emissions statistics on the map.

**Bar Chart Improvements**: We addressed minor issues in the bar chart from Milestone 2, particularly with the labels on the bars, ensuring they display correctly and enhance readability.

**Aesthetic Enhancements**: We refined the dashboardâ€™s aesthetic appeal by modifying the style and layout, including updates to the titles, title background, controller colors, and column hues. These changes aim to create a more visually appealing and cohesive user experience.


### Limitation
Currently, one challenge we identified is to synchronize the color schemes across all charts. We recognize that achieving a unified color palette would greatly enhance the visual consistency and user experience of our dashboard. Future enhancements may include aligning the colors of the bar and pie charts, which could help our audience to recognize and compare data across different visual representations.
