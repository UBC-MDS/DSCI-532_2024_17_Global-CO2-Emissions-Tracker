The dashboard of the Global CO2 Emission Tracker is composed of five components, designed to enrich user engagement and understanding. On the left, users are greeted with intuitive controls that allow for customization of data, including the selection of the specific range of years, countries, and continents of interest to CO2 emissions. Central to the dashboard is a dynamic map that highlights the chosen continents or countries, offering a visual representation of the user’s focus. Below this, a line chart unfolds the historical narrative of CO2 emission through a time series analysis, illustrating the trend of emissions by year. To the right, a pie chart offers perspectives on the selected region’s CO2 emissions, placed within the global context to underscore its relative impact. On the bottom right, there is a bar chart that displays the five highest CO2-emitting countries or regions within the same continent as the selected area. This chart provides a clear comparison of the total CO2 emissions, helping users understand how the selected country or region ranks among its continental peers.
