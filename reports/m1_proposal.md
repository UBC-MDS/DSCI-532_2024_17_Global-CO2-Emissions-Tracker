## 1. Motivation and purpose

### Our role: 
A team of UNEP (UN Environment Programme) officers and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) officers who want to raise awareness about CO2 emissions.

### Target audience: 
The general public with an interest in the environment.

### The problem the target audience is facing and how important it is:
The target audience faces the problem of increasing CO2 emissions, leading to climate change, air pollution, ocean pollution, health problem issues and lastly social-economic impacts. It's crucial to solve this issue to protect the environment, human health, and ensure a sustainable future for all.

### How our dashboard assist in solving this problem:
Our Global CO2 Emissions Tracker can give our target audience overview by providing time-series information on global CO2 emissions, sources and trends. This dashboard will help individuals to understand and feel the magnitude of this problem. They can track progress and be informed and can use it to assist on making decisions about personal and collective actions to reduce emissions. The CO2 data dashboard helps people understand CO2 emissions better by showing information in an easy-to-understand way. This makes people more aware of the problem, encourages them to take responsibility, and gets them involved in finding solutions to reduce CO2 emissions.

## 4. App sketch and description
The dashboard of the Global CO2 Emission Tracker is composed of five components, designed to enrich user engagement and understanding. On the left, users are greeted with intuitive controls that allow for customization of data, including the selection of the specific range of years, countries, and continents of interest to CO2 emissions. Central to the dashboard is a dynamic map that highlights the chosen continents or countries, offering a visual representation of the user’s focus. Below this, a line chart unfolds the historical narrative of CO2 emission through a time series analysis, illustrating the trend of emissions by year. To the right, a pie chart offers perspectives on the selected region’s CO2 emissions, placed within the global context to underscore its relative impact. On the bottom right, there is a bar chart that displays the five highest CO2-emitting countries or regions within the same continent as the selected area. This chart provides a clear comparison of the total CO2 emissions, helping users understand how the selected country or region ranks among its continental peers.
