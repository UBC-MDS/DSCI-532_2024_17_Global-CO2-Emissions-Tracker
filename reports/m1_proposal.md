It's crucial to solve this issue to protect the environment, human health, and ensure a sustainable future for all.

### How our dashboard assist in solving this problem:
Our Global CO2 Emissions Tracker can give our target audience overview by providing time-series information on global CO2 emissions, sources and trends. This dashboard will help individuals to understand and feel the magnitude of this problem. They can track progress and be informed and can use it to assist on making decisions about personal and collective actions to reduce emissions. The CO2 data dashboard helps people understand CO2 emissions better by showing information in an easy-to-understand way. This makes people more aware of the problem, encourages them to take responsibility, and gets them involved in finding solutions to reduce CO2 emissions.
