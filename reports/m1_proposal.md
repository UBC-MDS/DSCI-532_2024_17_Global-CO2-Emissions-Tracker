## 2. Description of the data

## 3. Research questions
Mary is a warm-hearted Vancouverite deeply invested in her community. On her way to work today, she learned about Vancouver's ambitious plan to achieve 'net zero' emissions by xxxx, a concept new to her. After a brief research, she became more interested in the topic and was eager to understand the broader context, to uncover the current status of global emissions. She wondered: How close are we to achieving 'net zero' globally? Are the world's largest emitters on track to meet these goals? What is the overall emissions landscape?

With these questions in mind, Mary accesses the 'Global CO2 Emissions Tracker.' Upon logging in, she will be greeted by a global map highlighting countries with higher emissions in darker shades. Adjacent to the map, a pie chart will offer a detailed breakdown of each country's contribution to global emissions. The interface will include several controls, allowing her to filter data by year, region, or specific countries of interest. A line chart will display the emission trends of selected countries, complemented by a histogram showcasing the top emitters in her chosen region.

Through her exploration, Mary may discover that global carbon emissions are escalating rapidly, though some major emitters are experiencing a slowdown in their growth rates. She may also realize that achieving 'net zero' emissions worldwide necessitates significant advancements. This revelation prompts her to consider what actions she can take in her daily life to contribute to reducing emissions.

## 4. App sketch and description
The dashboard of the Global CO2 Emission Tracker is composed of five components, designed to enrich user engagement and understanding. On the left, users are greeted with intuitive controls that allow for customization of data, including the selection of the specific range of years, countries, and continents of interest to CO2 emissions. Central to the dashboard is a dynamic map that highlights the chosen continents or countries, offering a visual representation of the user’s focus. Below this, a line chart unfolds the historical narrative of CO2 emission through a time series analysis, illustrating the trend of emissions by year. To the right, a pie chart offers perspectives on the selected region’s CO2 emissions, placed within the global context to underscore its relative impact. On the bottom right, there is a bar chart that displays the five highest CO2-emitting countries or regions within the same continent as the selected area. This chart provides a clear comparison of the total CO2 emissions, helping users understand how the selected country or region ranks among its continental peers.
